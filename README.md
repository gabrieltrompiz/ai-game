## About this project
This project was developed for Artificial Intelligence, back in 2018. We were supposed to create our own version of [Wumpus World](https://www.javatpoint.com/the-wumpus-world-in-artificial-intelligence), where a character is supposed to reach the treasure while avoiding a monster and two traps. This is also my first project using React. Used class components and Bootstrap.
